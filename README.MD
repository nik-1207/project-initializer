# Software Requirements Specification (SRS) - CLI Project Initializer for Node.js Projects

## 1. Introduction

The CLI Project Initializer is a Node.js command-line tool designed to streamline the process of creating new Node.js projects by automating the project setup. This tool will prompt the user for necessary project details and generate a basic project structure with the specified configurations.

## 2. Scope

The CLI Project Initializer aims to:

- Provide a simple and user-friendly interface for initializing new Node.js projects.
- Allow users to customize project details, such as project name, description, author name, and project template.
- Generate a project structure based on the selected template and install necessary dependencies.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1. User Interaction

The CLI tool shall interact with the user through the command-line interface to gather the following information:

- Project Name: A string representing the name of the new project.
- Project Description: A brief description of the project.
- Author Name: The name of the project author or creator.
- Project Template: The choice of project template from predefined templates.

### 3.2. Project Generation

After receiving the user's inputs, the CLI tool shall:

- Create a new project directory with the provided project name.
- Copy the selected project template files and folders into the new project directory.
- Replace placeholders in the template files (e.g., __PROJECT_NAME__, __DESCRIPTION__, __AUTHOR_NAME__) with the user-provided values.

### 3.3. Dependency Installation

The CLI tool shall automatically install project-specific dependencies based on the selected template, if any.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1. Usability

The CLI tool shall provide clear instructions and prompts to guide users through the project initialization process. It should handle invalid inputs gracefully and provide helpful error messages when needed.

### 4.2. Performance

The project initialization process should be efficient and completed in a reasonable time, even for larger templates.

### 4.3. Security

The CLI tool shall validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent any potential security vulnerabilities.

## 5. Predefined Project Templates

The CLI tool shall support the following predefined project templates:

1. **Basic Node.js Project Template:**
   - Minimal project structure with a simple `index.js` file.
   - No external dependencies.

2. **Express.js Project Template:**
   - Project structure for an Express.js web application.
   - Express.js and other related dependencies.

3. **Typescript Project Template:**
   - Project structure for a Node.js project with TypeScript support.
   - TypeScript and other related dependencies.

## 6. Constraints

- The CLI tool will be developed using Node.js and will require Node.js and npm to be installed on the user's machine.

## 7. Future Enhancements

- Add support for more project templates and configurations.
- Implement version control integration to initialize projects directly from Git repositories.

## 8. Conclusion

The CLI Project Initializer is intended to simplify the process of creating new Node.js projects by automating the project setup. By providing a straightforward command-line interface, users can quickly initialize new projects with minimal effort and avoid repetitive manual tasks.
